Top-down mouse-driven strategy game, focusing on front-line tactics. Uses LWJGL and Slick2D libraries.

The concept I'm working towards is a game where individual units would not be controlled directly, but instead commanded by moving a line (by clicking and dragging) that determines where the units form up. Dragging the line forward causes the units to advance, dragging it backwards induces a retreat, etc.

Screenshot forthcoming!
